# Data flow 
- The data flow in SODA typically involves the following steps:
    1. Data is ingested from various sources such as files, databases, or streams.
    2. The data is transformed and preprocessed using SODA's built-in data processing functions or custom user-defined functions.
    3. The processed data is stored in SODA's distributed object store, which allows for efficient and scalable storage and retrieval of large datasets.
    4. Data analytics applications are developed using SODA's APIs and libraries, which enable users to perform complex analytics tasks such as machine learning, graph processing, and real-time data processing.
    5. The results of data analytics tasks are stored in SODA's object store or exported to external systems for further analysis or visualization.

- Overall, SODA provides a flexible and scalable platform for managing and processing large datasets, enabling users to perform sophisticated data analytics tasks with ease.


# Migration
- Migration  refers to the process of transferring data and applications from one SODA environment to another, such as moving from a development environment to a production environment. 
- Migration in SODA typically involves the following steps:
    1. Exporting the data and applications from the source environment into a migration package, which is a compressed file that contains all the necessary files and metadata for the migration process.
    2. Transferring the migration package to the target environment, typically via a secure file transfer protocol such as SFTP.
    3. Importing the migration package into the target          environment, which involves unpacking the files and metadata and setting up the necessary configurations and dependencies.
    4. Testing the migrated data and applications in the target 
       environment to ensure that they function correctly and meet the desired performance criteria.
- To create a migration plan click on the create button and fill the details:
    1. Plan name: The plan name in creating a migration plan refers to the name or label assigned to the migration plan for identification and tracking purposes. The plan name should be unique and descriptive, and should reflect the scope and objective of the migration project. 
    2.  Source bucket: a source bucket refers to the data storage container from which the data is being migrated in a migration plan. A bucket is a logical container used in SODA to store data objects, such as files, images, or documents. 

    3. Destination bucket: a destination bucket refers to the data storage container to which the data is being migrated in a migration plan. The destination bucket is where the migrated data will reside after the migration is complete. 

    4. Execution time: Execution time refers to the estimated or actual time required to complete a migration plan. It is the duration of time from the start of the migration process to the completion of the migration. The execution time can vary depending on the size and complexity of the data.

## Infrastructure
---

### Block

- Block storage is a storage architecture that is commonly used to store structured data like databases and virtual machine disc images. Block storage allows for the reading and writing of data in fixed-size blocks, allowing for more efficient allocation and utilization of storage resources. 

- The block storage system, which includes the block storage software, the physical or virtual storage infrastructure that supports the block storage, and the APIs and interfaces that allow users to interact with the block storage system. 

- Many cloud-native applications that require high performance and low latency storage solutions rely on block storage. The SODA Foundation provides a platform for developers and organizations to collaborate on developing and improving cloud-native block storage solutions. 

 
 ### Object

 - Object storage is a type of storage architecture that uses a flat address space rather than a traditional file hierarchy to store data in a non-hierarchical manner. Object storage is a critical component for managing unstructured data in cloud-native environments, such as images, videos, and audio files. 

- It refers to various components of an object storage system, such as object storage software, physical or virtual storage infrastructure that supports object storage, and APIs and interfaces used to interact with the object storage system. 

- To provide scalable and resilient storage solutions for modern cloud applications, object storage is frequently used in conjunction with other cloud-native technologies such as Kubernetes. The SODA Foundation serves as a collaboration platform for developers and organizations. 

 ### File 

 - The Software Heritage project, hosted by the Software Freedom Conservancy and a member project of the Open-Source Initiative, helps to keep an archive of source code files for many open-source projects, including those hosted by the SODA Foundation. 

- Files are typically used to refer to source code files or other related artefacts that are used to build and deploy the SODA software stack, which includes projects such as SODA Opens DS and SODA Fabric. Configuration files, scripts, libraries, and other components required to build, test, and deploy the software may be included in these files. 

- Furthermore, the SODA Foundation keeps documentation files such as user guides, developer documentation, and other resources. These files are frequently kept in several different forms such as Markdown, HTML, and PDF. 


#### Region :- 
- Several regions are frequently used by cloud service providers and businesses to divide their infrastructure over various places, reducing the impact of outages 

#### Availability zones:-
 - Availability zones are frequently used to provide fault tolerance and high availability for cloud-native applications.
