Angular Snippets are code snippets that help you write Angular code faster and easier. They are short pieces of code that you can insert into your files by typing a keyword and pressing enter or activating them from within the editor. They are designed to follow the best practices and conventions of Angular and to reduce the amount of boilerplate code you have to write. For example, you can use a snippet to create a component with a selector, a template, and a class definition in TypeScript. You can also use snippets to create directives, services, pipes, modules, routes, actions, reducers, effects, selectors and more. Snippets can also help you with common tasks such as importing modules, creating forms, subscribing to observables, using material components, etc. Snippets are available for various editors and platforms, such as Visual Studio Code, Angular Snippets website, and Angular Snippets library. You can also create your own snippets or customize the existing ones to suit your needs and preferences. Snippets are a great way to speed up your development process and to learn from the best practices of Angular.

 # JSON 
 ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/123230201/232207907-bcf5f0a4-9969-4a6b-a50f-1342501c74ea.png)

 JSON is a format for storing and transporting data that is based on JavaScript object notation. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. JSON is a text format that is easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate. JSON is often used when data is sent from a server to a web page.
 
JSON data is written as name/value pairs, just like JavaScript object properties. A name/value pair consists of a field name (in double quotes), followed by a colon, followed by a value¹. For example: `"name": "John"`.
 
JSON objects are written inside curly braces. JSON objects can contain multiple name/value pairs. For example: `{"name": "John", "age": 30}`.
JSON arrays are written inside square brackets. JSON arrays can contain values or objects. For example: `["red", "green", "blue"]` or `[{"name": "John", "age": 30}, {"name": "Anna", "age": 25}]`.
 
JSON is language independent, meaning that it can be used by any programming language that can read and write text. JSON has a built-in function in JavaScript for converting JSON strings into JavaScript objects: `JSON.parse()`. JSON also has a built-in function in JavaScript for converting JavaScript objects into JSON strings: `JSON.stringify().
 
JSON is a useful format for exchanging data between computers and applications. It can help programmers work with data as JavaScript objects, with no complicated parsing and translations.

 # Usage Instructions 
 JSON is a data format that is common in configuration files like package.json or project.json. We also use it extensively in VS Code for our configuration files. Here are the steps to use it in VS Code:
1. Open a file that ends with .json in VS Code. VS Code provides features to make it simpler to write or modify the file's content, such as IntelliSense, validation, quick navigation, hovers, formatting, and folding.
2. You can also create a new file and save it with a .json extension. VS Code will automatically detect the file type and provide the same features as above.
3. If you want to use comments or trailing commas in your JSON file, you can switch to the JSON with Comments (jsonc) mode. This mode is used for the VS Code configuration files such as settings.json, tasks.json, or launch.json¹. You can change the mode by clicking on the mode indicator in the status bar and selecting "JSON with Comments" from the list.
4. To understand the structure of JSON files, we use JSON schemas. JSON schemas describe the shape of the JSON file, as well as value sets, default values, and descriptions. VS Code can associate a JSON file to a schema either by using the $schema attribute in the file itself, or by using the json.schemas setting in the User or Workspace settings.
5. You can also use extensions to enhance your JSON editing experience in VS Code. For example, you can use JsonPrettifier extension to automatically prettify JSON files when you open them, or you can use other extensions that provide additional snippets, validation, or formatting for JSON files.

 # How does it help users 
 JSON is a format for storing and transporting data between applications. Here are some details on how it helps users:
-	JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. It is a text format that follows the syntax of JavaScript objects, but it can be used by any programming language.
-	JSON is lightweight and self-describing. It uses name/value pairs to represent data, and curly braces to hold objects and square brackets to hold arrays.
-	JSON is easy to read and write for humans, and easy to parse and generate for machines. It can be converted into native JavaScript objects using JSON.parse() and vice versa using JSON.stringify().
-	JSON is widely used for data interchange on the web. It can be sent from a server to a web page, or from a web page to a server, using pure text. It can also be stored as a file or in a database.
-	JSON can handle different types of data, such as strings, numbers, booleans, nulls, objects, and arrays. It can also nest objects and arrays within each other to create complex data structures.
