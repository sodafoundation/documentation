This section provides Developer Guide for Dashboard UI of SODA Foundation. Focuses mainly on the development based on these features. If you are interested in just using the features, please refer the user guides or contact us through any of the technical channels.

- ### SODA Dashboard

    SODA Dashboard provides a unified interface to the underlying capabilities from the SODA Framework components. This dashboard is built mainly to illustrate/showcase various use cases that could run on SODA ecosystem projects.

    Technically, it is a direct client to SODA API and other projects which are getting integrated to SODA Ecosystem. It will be reference integration of all the underlying projects to realize various use cases.

    Every SODA release will have the SODA Dashboard with new use cases integrated based on the new features or projects integrated to SODA project ecosystem.
